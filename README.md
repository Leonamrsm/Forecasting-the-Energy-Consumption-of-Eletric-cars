A transport and logistics company wants to migrate its fleet to electric cars in order to reduce costs.

Before making the decision, the company would like to forecast the energy consumption of electric cars based on various usage factors and vehicle characteristics.

Using a real dataset with [publicly available](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tb9yrptydn/2), a Machine Learning model will be built capable of predicting the energy consumption of electric cars based on several factors, such as the type and number of electric motors in the vehicle, vehicle weight, load capacity, among other attributes.

This dataset lists all-electric cars that, as of December 2, 2020, could be purchased in Poland as new at an authorized dealership and those available in public and general pre-sale, but only if a publicly available price list with complete equipment versions and technical parameters was available. with your attributes

The collection does not contain data on hybrid cars and electric cars of so-called “range extenders”. Hydrogen cars were also not included in the dataset due to the insufficient number of mass-produced models and the different specificity (compared to electric vehicle) of the vehicle, including the different charging methods.

The database composed of 53 electric cars (each variant of a model – which differs in terms of battery capacity, engine power, etc. – is treated separately) and 22 variables (25 variables, including brand, model and “car name”). car” merging these two previous ones).
